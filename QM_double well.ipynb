    "### _Introduction:_\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Mechanics \\(QM\\) has a monumental impact on the way we interpret the phenomena around us. QM mathematically interprets how particles interact with each other on a subatomic scale! It treats the properties of these particles \\(position, momentum\\) as being given as a wavefunction, $\\psi$ \\[1:51\\-76\\].  In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger came up with a very famous equation known as the Schrödinger equation \\[2\\]. This equation is at the core of quantum mechanics and describes the behavior of a quantum particle. The equation provides the base for calculating energy levels in a given potential with boundary conditions. These energy levels are quantized \\(can have only a set of discrete values\\) \\[1:81–128\\]. The equation also provides the basis for the change of the probability density over time, the probability density is simply  $|\\psi|^2$ \\[1:51\\-76\\]. The infinite square well is a special case of the Schrödinger equation where a particle is confined to a region of space \\[1: 133–189\\] and is mostly used to introduce the basic principles of quantum mechanics which in turn can then be applied to more complex systems. The potential is equal to 0 within that space, and outside it is infinite; therefore, the particle can not escape and is confined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, the fundamental code will be tested for an infinite well with first, a given energy level and then with no given energy level where a plot $\\psi$ will be the result. This can be done, thanks to the special nature of this well, that the boundary conditions are easily established \\[1:133–189\\]. This will then allow us to plot $\\psi$ . Once all these works, a new layer of complication will be added, of a bump within the well. This bump will be centered and will have a finite, defined potential inside the well, meaning there will be more boundary conditions. The aim of this report is to obtain a plot of $\\psi$  and the probability density with no given energy levels for an infinite well with a bump in the middle.\n",

Firstly, TISE is a second order ODE and to be able to plot $\\psi$ it will need to be rearranged for the second derivative and solved. Rearranging TISE gives: \\begin{equation}\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -k\\psi(E-V)\\end{equation}Where k is given by $\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}$, for now V = 0 and thus can be disregarded.

    "\n",
    "It was shown in the discussion that the goal of plotting the wave function and probability density of an infinite well with a bump was achieved. The limitation of this method is that the values of n are not accurate this is since most differential equations don't have known exact solutions. This means that perturbation theory would have to be used to achieve a more accurate result for n. Another limitation is that when the potential gets too big tunneling takes place changing the boundary conditions \\[1: 133\\-189\\] and adding another level of complication to the code. Improving the code to includ tunneling means that it could then be applied to more complex systems and more realistic scenario. For example by removing the infinite well and placing the box in a finite potential.\n",
